This repository contains the Arduino code and system documentation for a lightweight and low-cost GPS logging system mounted on a commercial drone (SG906 MAX2 BEAST 3E). The system is based on the Arduino Mega 2560 platform and records data using the u-blox NEO-6M GPS module, and stores the data on a microSD card.
